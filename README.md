<h2> Farm Application:</h2>
<h3>Design and Implementation Part 1        |      CS 420, Fall 2020       |      Due Oct. 23, 2020</h3>
Our group has created a dashboard for our automated farm application. 
We have also created an animation depicting the movement of a drone throughout the farm.
<br>

<h3>Application Instructions</h3>

1. Run the Java project in IntelliJ IDEA by opening the project directory, and running it from the **MainApp** class.
2. You may create, edit, and delete items and item containers (excluding the farm, which is the root item container)
by utilizing the on screen text inputs and buttons. 
3. After you have created the farm items in their desired locations, you may begin the drone animation. 
The on screen buttons can be used to control the drone animation. To have the drone fly to an item, select the desired item in the tree view.
4. After selecting the item you'd like the drone to fly to, click the "Visit Item" button. The drone will then travel to the (X,Y) coordinates at the object's center.  

<h3> Application Requirements </h3>

This project was created with Java JDK 8 (also listed as 1.8) and JavaFX. 
Our team used IntelliJ IDEA to create this project.
 
We recommend you use IntelliJ when viewing and running this.
